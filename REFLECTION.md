1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code, set up GitHub page. The game menu
	is functioning and will launch Stage objects for each game. 2048 is rendering
	and Tetris's underlying logic has been started.

2. **TODO:** Finish implementing game logic for both games.

3. **PROB:** Confusion about the differences between drawing the game and
	implementing the game logic, specifically how to split up the classes
	accordingly.
