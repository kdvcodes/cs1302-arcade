1. **DONE:** Downloaded the skeleton code, set up GitHub page. The game menu
	is functioning and will launch Stage objects for each game. 2048 is rendering
	and Tetris's underlying logic has been started.

2. **TODO:** Finish implementing game logic for both games.

3. **PROB:** Confusion about the differences between drawing the game and
	implementing the game logic, specifically how to split up the classes
	accordingly.

1. **DONE:** Tetris is fully playable. Parent classes for both games are set up.
	Much of what has been learned with Tetris can apply to 2048.

2. **TODO:** Implement score, levels, along with getting 2048 playable.

3. **PROB:** Making parent classes that remained functional in their respective
	games. Learned plenty about inheritance.

1. **DONE:** 2048 is playable, lots of extra features in Tetris, including score
tracking, next piece showing, and animations.

2. **TODO:** Document code and make game finish conditions.

3. **PROB:** Lots of difficulty in getting 2048 to move correctly and to only
combine certain tiles. Also implementing animations was very time-consuming.
